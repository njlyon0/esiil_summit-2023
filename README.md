# Environmental Data Science Innovation & Inclusion Lab (ESIIL) Innovation Summit 2023.

This repository can be a central hub for anything I need to write / code for the [2023 innovation summit](https://esiil.org/innovation-summit).

## Guidelines for Contributing

Open [a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/njlyon0/esiil_summit-2023/issues) requesting to be added as a collaborator. Once there is more than just me working here we can have a conversation about what sort of guidelines make the most sense (and minimize the risk of merge conflicts as much as possible!)
